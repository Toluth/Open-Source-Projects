    "In this project, we will work with exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland)) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE). The data of the exit survey for DETE can be found [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey) and for the TAFE [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey).\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis will be done with the hope to answer the below questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there for longer?\n",
    "\n",
    "* How many people in each age group resigned due to some kind of dissatisfaction?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer these questions, we would analyse the above-stated data in order to understand the reasons why certain types of employees are leaving or resigning.\n",

    "* `ID`: An id used to identify the participant of the survey\n",
    "* `SeparationType`: The reason why the person's employment ended\n",
